# The Valency Exchange
Contains the code dedicated to the Valency Exchange. This utilises valency-core for key functions.<br>
The valency-exchange repository is split up into the following components (not yet set in stone):
1. **Smart Contracts:** The smart-contracts that fullfill transactions and perform auxilary tasks on the Valency Exchange.
2. **Various Backend Systems:** The backend systems responsible for communicating with the smart-contracts and fulfilling transactions.
3. **System Diagrams:** To allow customers to view a simplified version of how the open-source software processes transactions.
4. **App Code:** Allows customers to audit the in-app crypto wallets.
<br>

**Please note that this structure may change in the future**
