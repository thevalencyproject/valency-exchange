# The Valency Exchange Basic Hierarchy Overview
## Role Definition
1. Project Lead Developers: These individuals are in charge of maintaining the project's strategic direction, making crucial design and technology decisions, and coordinating the project's overall development efforts.

2. Senior Developers (employed by the Valency Network/Exchange): These are experienced developers hired to implement complex parts of the project and help junior developers and volunteers understand the project.

3. Junior Developers (employed by the Valency Network/Exchange): Junior developers are hired to work on less complex parts of the project under the supervision of senior developers and the project lead.

4. Open-Source Community Volunteer Developers: These individuals are unpaid contributors who can submit pull requests with their changes. While these changes are not guaranteed to be committed to the main branch, they are an essential part of the open-source community's collaborative nature.

## Workload Split Strategy
### Project Lead Developers
1. Design and Architecture: The Project Leads are responsible for designing the project's overall architecture, making major design and technology choices, and ensuring all parts of the project align with the desired direction.

2. Code Review: The Project Leads review the more complex pull requests, especially those touching the project's core architecture.

3. Communications and Coordination: The Lead Developers handle coordination with external stakeholders, manage project resources, and lead discussions about the project's strategic direction. They also mentor and provide guidance to the senior and junior developers.

### Senior Developers
1. Implementing Complex Parts: Senior developers are tasked with implementing complex parts of the project that require more experience and deep knowledge of the project and its technology stack.

2. Code Review: Senior developers review the code from junior developers and volunteer contributors, providing them with valuable feedback and ensuring the project maintains high code quality standards.

3. Mentoring Junior Developers: Senior developers also mentor junior developers, guiding them through the project and helping them improve their programming and problem-solving skills.

### Junior Developer
1. Implementing Less Complex Parts: Junior developers work on simpler parts of the project, gradually increasing their complexity as they gain more experience.

2. Bug Fixing: Junior developers can be assigned to fix bugs identified in the project. This will help them understand the project more deeply and expand their skill-set.

3. Documentation: Junior developers are also responsible for updating and maintaining the project documentation, which helps them understand the project and code-base better whilst helping the community.

### Open-Source Community Contributors
1. Feature Development: Volunteer developers can propose and develop new features for the project. Although their changes are not guaranteed to be committed, they can bring innovative ideas to the table.

2. Bug Reporting and Fixing: Volunteers can play a crucial role in identifying bugs and even proposing fixes, which can be reviewed by senior or lead developers.

3. Documentation and Translation: Volunteers can help maintain and update project documentation, and they can contribute to translating documentation to make the project accessible to Non-English/Croatian speakers.

## Quick Notes
Since The Valency Project is open-source, it is important to ensure that everybody feels valued for their contributions. Recognition and appreciation for all types of contributions are key to keeping the projects momentum. It is also important to regularly reassess the workload/compensations and adjust the plan based on the project’s evolution and the team’s capabilities.

## Possible Additional Roles (for down the line)
1. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Responsible for creating and executing tests to ensure the software meets the defined requirements and is of high quality (i.e. bug-free and optimised). They should help create automated testing scripts, saving time and increasing the overall efficiency of the development process.

2. Development Operations (DevOps) Engineer: Responsible for handling the automation of deployment, integration, and system management tasks. This can ensure faster, more reliable releases,, allowing the core developers to focus more on programming rather than infrastructure and deployment issues.

3. UX/UI Developer: Responsible for optimising the user experience and interface. This ensures that the project is not only functionally sound, but also user-friendly, increasing user satisfaction and network adoption.

4. Data Analyst: Responsible for helping the team make data-informed decisions by providing insights about the software usage, bugs, performance. This helps the team prioritise the features or improvements that will have the biggest impact on the network.

5. Security Analyst: Responsible for undertaking audits and finding any potential security vulnerabilities (not just in the code, but in developer accounts – fake phishing links, etc.). Since the Valency Project revolves around two very sensitive systems (a decentralised network and an exchange), MULTIPLE security analysts (both external and internal) should be tasked with finding any possible vulnerabilities.

6. Community Manager: Responsible for managing and guiding the community of volunteer contributors, organising events, managing communication, resolving conflicts, and promoting the project to a wider audience.

7. Technical Writer (Documentation): Responsible for grasping existing code and creating and maintaining comprehensive documentation. Good documentation is crucial for open-source projects to guide users and new contributors, easing their learning curve and fostering their involvement.
